 <p>Muster is a location based social discovery application. It allows your GPS to locate restaurants and friends (or fellow muster users) around you to choose from. In short, it allows you to meet-greet and eat. Invite a person, or a group of people, to share a meal. Once your invite is accepted, the chat option allows you to further discuss details about your plans for the meal.

coffee or a meal with somebody who is also killing time, waiting for
their flight.</li>

be invite a local, to guide you around the city's authentic food
destinations.
</li>

<li>
